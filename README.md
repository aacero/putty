# PuTTY with GSS-API key exchange
***

This repository contains the
[PuTTY SSH client] (http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/),
patched to support GSS-API key exchange. It also contains patches to
build a Win64-version of PuTTY, complete with support for the 64-bit
version of [MIT Kerberos for Windows] (http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/dist/index.html#kfw-4.0).

You may find binaries [here] (https://marcussundberg.com/putty/).
